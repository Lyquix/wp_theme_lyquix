# Widget Positions

`@version     2.1.0`

The theme includes several widget positions that you can use or ignore as needed. Below is the list with its recommended placement:

  * `head-scripts`: at the end of the `<head>` tag, use it to load additional CSS code, JS code, and meta tags.
  * `body-scripts`: at the end of the `<body>` tag, use it to load end-of-the-page JS code.
  * `header`, `nav-header`, `util`, `top`: use for positions in the header/top area of the page.
  * `footer`, `nav-footer`, `bottom`, `copyright`: use for positions in the header/bottom area or the page.
  * `left`, `center`, `right`, `before`, `after`, `aside`, `prev`, `next`: various position to be used as you need.
